This, in turn, would make it accessible for everyone. If you feel any section fails at that intention, please let me know in the comments and I’ll try to improve that section)</em></p><p>Adults like to use a lot of complicated words to say something. This could be because they want to show their impressive vocabulary. It gets worse in technical fields like Computer Science which have a lot of big technical words. These technical words are supposed to help differentiate between similar ideas. But most often it complicates simple ideas. In this article, I’ll try not to use these complicated words. This is so that you can understand the ideas clearly rather than memorize big words. So let’s get started with a bit of history.</p><h2>Let’s take it from the top.</h2><p>You might have seen computers all around you. From the smartwatch to phones, tablets, and laptops — they are all different forms of computers. These useful gadgets of today have always been “Dumb Machines”. They are good at obeying orders like an obedient puppy (or kitten for those who are weird like that 😀). If you tell it to Swipe Right, it swipes right. If you tell it to Swipe Left, it swipes left. If you tell it to open Instagram when someone clicks on the Instagram icon it will open it. You get the drift. It can’t think of anything on its own.</p><p>Although these machines are dumb, over the last 50 years, we have made the computers do many things. From adding numbers and playing songs to defeating grandmasters at Chess. But for each of those things, someone had to tell the computer what to do and exactly how to do it.</p><p>So the things that a computer could do for us was limited. Computers could only do things that we could show them how to do (step by step). As you could guess, that magic lost its charm pretty soon. There are always some things where :</p><ul><li>even humans don’t know how to do it (let alone explain to the computer)</li><li>and some tasks where we don’t know how to tell the computer what to do. ( we can’t explain it clearly in a language that machine could understand)</li></ul><p>( <em>A big word for telling computers what to do and how to do it is </em><strong><em>programming. </em></strong><em>But we wouldn’t use these big words because we don’t wanna be adults yet.</em>)</p></div><div><h2>What\\'s the story today?</h2><p>For a very long time, computers couldn’t do anything without someone telling them how to do something. This was true until recently. Some very smart people* found a way to teach computers to learn by themselves. (<em>Another big word adults use for this is </em><strong><em>Machine Learning, </em></strong><em>but psst. who needs that</em>). Imagine you are in a classroom without a teacher. There you and all your classmates learn on your own without any teacher. Weird right? Imagine how weird it must be for a computer to learn on its own. Surprisingly the computer is very good at learning on its own. It can even learn complicated things that people can’t teach it.</p><p><em>(* The pioneers of this field didn’t give up on computers -like some good dedicated teachers.

I imagine there are a lot of people who tried reading <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning\">the wikipedia article</a>, got frustrated and gave up wishing someone would just give them a high-level explanation. That’s what this is.</p><p>The goal is be accessible to anyone — which means that there’s a lot of generalizations. But who cares? If this gets anyone more interested in ML, then mission accomplished.</p></div><div><h2>What is machine learning?</h2><p>Machine learning is the idea that there are generic algorithms that can tell you something interesting about a set of data without you having to write any custom code specific to the problem. Instead of writing code, you feed data to the generic algorithm and it builds its own logic based on the data.</p><p>For example, one kind of algorithm is a classification algorithm. It can put data into different groups. The same classification algorithm used to recognize handwritten numbers could also be used to classify emails into spam and not-spam without changing a line of code. It’s the same algorithm but it’s fed different training data so it comes up with different classification logic.</p><figure><figcaption>This machine learning algorithm is a black box that can be re-used for lots of different classification problems.</figcaption></figure><p>“Machine learning” is an umbrella term which covers a lot of these kinds of generic algorithms.</p></div><div><h2>Two kinds of Machine Learning Algorithms</h2><p>You can think of machine learning algorithms as falling into one of two main categories — <strong>supervised learning</strong> and <strong>unsupervised learning</strong>. The difference is simple, but really important.</p><h2>Supervised Learning</h2><p>Let’s say you are a real estate agent. Your business is growing, so you hire a bunch of new trainee agents to help you out. But there’s a problem — you can glance at a house and have a pretty good idea of what a house is worth, but your trainees don’t have your experience so they don’t know how to price their houses.</p><p>To help your trainees (and maybe free yourself up for a vacation), you decide to write a little app that can estimate the value of a house in your area based on it’s size, neighborhood, etc, and what similar houses have sold for.</p><p>So you write down every time someone sells a house in your city for 3 months. For each house, you write down a bunch of details — number of bedrooms, size in square feet, neighborhood, etc. But most importantly, you write down the final sale price:</p><figure><figcaption>This is our “training data.”</figcaption></figure><p>Using that training data, we want to create a program that can estimate how much any other house in your area is worth:</p><figure><figcaption>We want to use the training data to predict the prices of other houses.</figcaption></figure><p>This is called <strong>supervised learning</strong>. You knew how much each house sold for, so in other words, you knew the answer to the problem and could work backwards from there to figure out the logic.</p><p>To build your app, you feed your training data about each house into your machine learning algorithm. The algorithm is trying to figure out what kind of math needs to be done to make the numbers work out.</p><p>This kind of like having the answer key to a math test with all the arithmetic symbols erased:</p><figure><figcaption>Oh no! A devious student erased the arithmetic symbols from the teacher’s answer key!</figcaption></figure><p>From this, can you figure out what kind of math problems were on the test? You know you are supposed to “do something” with the numbers on the left to get each answer on the right.</p><p>In <strong>supervised learning</strong>, you are letting the computer work out that relationship for you. And once you know what math was required'),\n",

These are the underpinnings of many techniques in machine learning, though it is often difficult to find a clear and concise explanation of these basic methods.\\n\\nParameter estimation will cover Gaussian parameter estimation of the following types: known variance, unknown mean; known mean, unknown variance; and unknown mean, unknown variance.\\n\\nRegression will cover linear regression, linear regression using alternate basis functions, bayesian linear regression, and bayesian linear regression with model selection.\\n\\nClassification will extend the topic of regression, exploring k-means clustering, linear discriminants, logistic regression, and support vector machines, with some discussion of relevance vector machines for \\\\\"soft\\\\\" decision making.\\n\\nStarting from simple statistics and working upward, I hope to provide a clear grounding of how basic machine learning works mathematically. Understanding the math behind parameter estimation, regression, and classification will help individuals gain an understanding of the more complicated methods in machine learning. This should help demystify some of the modern approaches to machine learning, leading to better technique selection in real-world applications.\\n| view_count: 85,655 views | short_view_count: 85K

For example, here is a compiler written in Rust that turns 0s into 1s, and 1s into 0s:</p><figure><figcaption>While this compiler doesn’t read a file, doesn’t generate an AST, and doesn’t produce binary, it is still considered a compiler for the simple reason that it translates an input.</figcaption></figure><h2>What a Compiler Does</h2><p>In short, compilers take source code and produce binary. Since it would be pretty complicated to go straight from complex, human readable code to ones and zeros, compilers have several steps of processing to do before their programs are runnable:</p><ol><li>Reads the individual characters of the source code you give it.</li><li>Sorts the characters into words, numbers, symbols, and operators.</li><li>Takes the sorted characters and determines the operations they are trying to perform by matching them against patterns, and making a tree of the operations.</li><li>Iterates over every operation in the tree made in the last step, and generates the equivalent binary.</li></ol><p><em>While I say the compiler immediately goes from a tree of operations to binary, it actually generates assembly code, which is then assembled/compiled into binary. Assembly is like a higher-level, human-readable binary. Read more about what assembly is </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><figure></figure><h2>What an Interpreter is</h2><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)\">Interpreters</a> are much like compilers in that they read a language and process it. Though, <strong>interpreters skip code generation and execute the AST </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation\"><strong>just-in-time</strong></a><strong>. </strong>The biggest advantage to interpreters is the time it takes to start running your program during debug. A compiler may take anywhere from a second to several minutes to compile a program before execution, while an interpreter begins executing immediately, with no compilation.'),\n",

Keep in mind that the subject\\nof compiler construction is usually taught in a one- or two-semester course; our\\nintroduction will necessarily only touch on the basics.\\nOur description of the functions of a compiler follows the structure in Figure\\n2.31 on page 116. To illustrate the concepts in this section, we will use the C ver-\\nsion of a while loop from an earlier section:\\nwhile (saveli] == k)\\njit=1;\\nThe Front End\\nThe function of the front end is to read in a source program, check the syntax and\\nsemantics, and translate the source program to an intermediate form that inter-\\nprets most of the language-specific operation of the program. As we will see, inter-\\nmediate forms are usually simple, and some are in fact similar to the Java\\nbytecodes, which can be found in Section 2.14.\\nThe front end is usually broken into four separate functions:\\n1. Scanning reads in individual characters and creates a string of tokens.\\nExamples of tokens are reserved words, names, operators, and punctuation\\n» ae « » «>\\n>\\nsymbols. In the above example, the token sequence is “while”, “(“ “save”,\\nB,D, “=3\", SK, 9”, “2, “+=”, “1”. A word like “while” is recognized as a\\norice ceo, ‘\\nreserved word in C, but “save”, “i”, and “j” are recognized as names, and “1”\\nis recognized as a number.\\n> >\\n2. Parsing takes the token stream, ensures the syntax is correct, and produces\\nan abstract syntax tree, which is a representation of the syntactic structure of\\nthe program. Figure 2.12.1 shows what the abstract syntax tree might look\\nlike for this program fragment.\\n3. Semantic analysis takes the abstract syntax tree and checks the program for\\nsemantic correctness. Semantic checks normally ensure that variables and\\ntypes are properly declared and that the types of operators and objects\\nmatch, a step called type checking. During this process, a symbol table rep-\\nresenting all the named objects—classes, variables, and functions—is usu-\\nally created and used to type check the program.\\n\\x0c2.12-2 2.12 How Compilers Work: An Introduction\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nwhile statement\\nwhile condition statement body\\nexpression += assignment\\n1\\n== comparison left-hand side expression\\nexpression expression identifier factor\\nfactor ae number\\narray access = 1\\narray expression I\\nidentifier a\\nsave vei\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 2.12.1 An abstract syntax tree for the while example.

The format of a file is defined by its content since a file is solely a container for data, although, on some platforms the format is usually indicated by its filename extension, specifying the rules for how the bytes must be organized and interpreted meaningfully. For example, the bytes of a plain text file (<code>.txt</code> in Windows) are associated with either ASCII or UTF-8 characters, while the bytes of image, video, and audio files are interpreted otherwise.

The tokenizer is responsible for dividing the input stream into \\nindividual tokens, identifying the token type, and passing tokens one at a time to the next stage of the \\ncompiler.\\n</p><p>\\nThe next stage of the compiler is called the <i>Parser</i>. This part of the compiler has an \\nunderstanding of the language\\'s grammar. It is responsible for identifying syntax errors and for \\ntranslating an error free program into internal data structures that can be interpreted or written out in \\nanother language. \\n</p><p>\\nThe data structure is called a <i>Parse Tree</i>, or sometimes an <i>Intermediate Code \\nRepresentation</i>. The parse tree is a language independent structure, which gives a great deal of \\nflexibility to the code generator. The lexer and parser together are often referred to as the compiler\\'s front \\nend. The rest of the compiler is called the back end. Due to the language independent nature of the parse \\ntree, it is easy, once the front end is in place, to replace the back end with a code generator for a different \\nhigh level language, or a different machine language, or replacing the code generator all together with an \\ninterpreter. This approach allows a compiler to be easily ported to another type of computer, or for a \\nsingle compiler to produce code for a number of different computers (cross compilation).\\n</p><p>\\nSometimes, especially on smaller systems, the intermediate representation is written to disk. This allows \\nthe front end to be unloaded from RAM, and RAM is not needed for the intermediate representation. This \\nhas two disadvantages: it is slower, and it requires that the parse tree be translated to a form that can be \\nstored on disk. \\n</p><p>\\nThe next step in the process is to send the parse tree to either an interpreter, where it is executed, or to a \\ncode generator preprocessor. Not all compilers have a code generator preprocessor. The preprocessor has \\ntwo jobs. The first is to break any expressions into their simplest components. For example, the \\nassignment <b>a := 1 + 2 * 3</b> would be broken into <b>temp := 2 * 3; a := 1 + \\ntemp;</b> Such expressions are called <i>Binary Expressions</i>. Such expressions are necessary \\nfor generating assembler language code. Compilers that translate from one high level language to another \\noften do not contain this step. Another task of the code generator preprocessor is to perform certain \\nmachine independent optimizations.\\n</p><p>\\nAfter preprocessing, the parse tree is sent to the <i>code generator</i>, which creates a new file in the \\ntarget language. Sometimes the newly created file is then <i>post processed</i> to add machine \\ndependent optimizations.\\n</p><p>\\nFigure 1 shows graphically the different parts of a compiler;\\n</p><p>\\n<br />\\n \\n<b>Figure 1. Anatomy of a Compiler</b>\\n</p><p>\\nInterpreters are sometimes called <i>virtual machines</i>. This stems from the idea that a CPU is \\nactually a low level interpreter - it interprets machine code. An interpreter is a high level simulation of a \\nCPU.\\n</p><p>\\n<a href=\"#COMPILER_ANATOMY\">\\nReturn to beginning of the Anatomy and Tokenizer page\\n</a>\\n</p><hr />'),\n",

       "\"Load balancing is a concept used to distribute incoming application and network traffic across multiple servers, ensuring that no single server is overloaded. Load balancers are placed between users and server clusters and distribute requests from users across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests. The load balancer utilizes algorithms to evenly distribute the traffic, increasing the capacity and reliability of applications. If one server goes down, the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining healthy servers. Load balancers are used by organizations that have high levels of website activity or mission-critical web and mobile applications. There are two types of load balancers available: hardware devices and software solutions. Hardware devices are physical devices installed in organizations' IT departments or data centers, while software solutions can be installed on physical or virtual machines in data centers, on-premises, or in the cloud. Using load balancers helps organizations manage high volume concurrent requests and ensures a smooth and uninterrupted user experience.\""
